## User Experience
``
1. User/Visitor is given a question, and is provided with 4 posible answers, in which only one can be selected. 
2. 3 of the 4 selection will be  wrong
3. Upon clicking the button to submit their selection on each question, the visitor would be told if their selection was correct
4. I will have anywhere from 10-20 diffrent questions. 
``
## Next Features Coming soon
