For this game I want to make it light game tha alllows a vistor to interact with my code, which in this case will be a game of trivia.
The subject matter for this is has yet to be determined. 
The only problem I forsee me having at this time is if a user refreses theiere screen there will be know way to capture previos inputs as this is all broswer based no cookies and random. 
Once the player has been satified with the questions they can choose to simmply exit the game from the browser level.
